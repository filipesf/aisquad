# Mission Control

Multi-agent task orchestration system. Agents register, receive heartbeats, get assigned tasks through a lease-based mechanism, and communicate via comments with @-mention notifications — all coordinated through a Fastify API, background workers, and a React dashboard.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- (Optional) Node.js (ES2022+) and pnpm 10.17+ for local development

### Quick Start (Docker)

One command starts everything — Postgres, Redis, migrations, API, workers, and the UI:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Check status:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Verify:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# → {"status":"ok","db":true,"redis":true}

open http://localhost:5173
```

To include OpenClaw workers:

```bash
docker compose --profile openclaw up -d
```

### Local Development (without Docker for apps)

If you prefer hot reload during development, run infrastructure in Docker and apps bare:

```bash
# Start only Postgres + Redis
docker compose up -d postgres redis

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the shared package
pnpm --filter @mc/shared build

# Run database migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Start all apps in parallel (with hot reload)
pnpm dev
```

Or start services individually:

```bash
pnpm --filter @mc/control-api dev     # API on port 3000
pnpm --filter @mc/mission-ui dev      # UI on port 5173
pnpm --filter @mc/workers assigner    # Task assigner
pnpm --filter @mc/workers offline-detector
pnpm --filter @mc/workers notification-dispatcher
```

## Core Concepts

### Task State Machine

```
queued ──────▶ assigned ──────▶ in_progress ──────▶ review ──────▶ done
  ▲              │  ▲              │                  │
  │              ▼  │              ▼                  ▼
  └──────────── blocked ◀─────────┘──────────────────┘
```

Valid transitions:

| From          | To                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `queued`      | `assigned`                                    |
| `assigned`    | `in_progress`, `blocked`, `queued`            |
| `in_progress` | `review`, `blocked`                           |
| `review`      | `done`, `blocked`, `in_progress`              |
| `blocked`     | `queued`, `assigned`, `in_progress`, `review` |
| `done`        | _(terminal)_                                  |

### Assignment Lifecycle

Assignments use a **lease-based model** with a configurable TTL (default 30s):

1. **Offered** — assigner picks a queued task and an eligible online agent; creates assignment with `lease_expires_at`
2. **Accepted** — agent accepts within the lease window; task moves to `in_progress`
3. **Completed** — agent finishes work; task moves to `review`
4. **Expired** — lease expires without acceptance; task returns to `queued` for reassignment

A **unique partial index** (`ux_assignments_active_task`) on `(task_id) WHERE status IN ('offered', 'accepted', 'started')` guarantees that no task has more than one active assignment at any time.

### Agent Heartbeat Protocol

- Agents send periodic heartbeats with an optional `sequence_id`
- First heartbeat transitions an agent from `offline` → `online`
- Subsequent heartbeats update `last_seen_at`
- The offline-detector worker marks agents as `offline` when `3 × heartbeat_interval_ms` elapses without a heartbeat
- Sequence-based dedup via Redis SET NX (60s TTL) prevents duplicate processing

### Comment → Notification Pipeline

1. Agent posts a comment on a task
2. Author is auto-subscribed to the task
3. `@mentions` in the comment body are parsed and resolved to agent IDs
4. Mentioned agents are auto-subscribed to the task
5. Notifications are enqueued for all subscribers except the author
6. Redis dedup (5s TTL) prevents duplicate notifications per source
7. The notification-dispatcher worker delivers notifications to online agents with exponential backoff (up to 5 retries)

## Workers

Four independent background processes that poll PostgreSQL:

| Worker                      | Interval                 | Function                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Offline Detector**        | 10s (`OFFLINE_POLL_MS`)  | Marks agents as offline when heartbeats stop (3× interval threshold)                                 |
| **Assigner**                | 10s (`ASSIGNER_POLL_MS`) | Expires stale leases, then matches queued tasks to online agents by capability                       |
| **Notification Dispatcher** | 5s (`NOTIF_POLL_MS`)     | Delivers queued notifications to online agents; retries with exponential backoff                     |
| **Daily Standup**           | one-shot                 | Generates a digest of the last 24h: tasks completed/blocked/created, agent outages, assignment churn |
| **OpenClaw Dispatcher**     | 10s (`OPENCLAW_DISPATCH_POLL_MS`) | Polls for offered assignments on OpenClaw-enabled agents; dispatches to `/hooks/agent`; tracks each attempt in `openclaw_dispatch_attempts` with exponential backoff (max 5 retries) |
| **OpenClaw Heartbeat Bridge** | 10s (`OPENCLAW_DISPATCH_POLL_MS`) | Sends periodic heartbeats for all OpenClaw-backed agents to keep their Mission Control status `online` |

Workers are stateless — they can be killed and restarted without data loss. All state lives in PostgreSQL.

## OpenClaw Integration (v1)

Mission Control supports optional integration with an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/flare/openclaw) AI gateway. When enabled, OpenClaw-backed agents can be kept online via a heartbeat bridge and receive task assignments dispatched to the OpenClaw `/hooks/agent` endpoint.

### v1 Scope

- **Worker-pull only**: Mission Control dispatches to OpenClaw. No inbound callbacks from OpenClaw.
- **Identity mapping**: OpenClaw agent metadata is stored in the `agents.capabilities.openclaw` JSON field.
- **Comment-first output**: OpenClaw responses are persisted as Mission Control task comments. External channel delivery (Discord, Slack, etc.) is disabled by default.

### Enabling

Set the following environment variables:

```bash
OPENCLAW_ENABLED=true
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:8080   # Your OpenClaw gateway URL
OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN=your-hooks-token       # Bearer token for /hooks/agent
```

When `OPENCLAW_ENABLED=true`, the workers will fail fast on startup if `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL` or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` are missing.

With `OPENCLAW_ENABLED=false` (the default), all OpenClaw-related behavior is inert — no workers start, no dispatches occur.

### Agent Registry Sync

Fleet Status reflects rows in Mission Control's `agents` table. To keep it aligned with the OpenClaw VM agent list, run:

```bash
pnpm agents:sync-openclaw
```

This sync command:

- Reads `agents.list` from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` in the VM (via `orb`)
- Creates missing Mission Control agents
- Updates existing synced agent metadata (`name`, `session_key`, `capabilities.openclaw`)
- Disables stale OpenClaw mappings that no longer exist in OpenClaw
- Sends heartbeat for synced agents so Fleet Status transitions to `online`

Optional environment overrides:

- `OPENCLAW_VM` (default: `aisquad`)
- `OPENCLAW_STATE_PATH` (default: `/home/filipefernandes/.openclaw/openclaw.json`)
- `CONTROL_API_URL` (default: `http://localhost:3000`)

### Output Handling

OpenClaw responses are persisted as **Mission Control task comments** — the dispatcher calls `POST /tasks/:id/comments?author_id={agentId}` on the Control API. This means:

- The agent is auto-subscribed to the task
- `@mentions` in the response trigger the standard notification pipeline
- Comments appear in the task detail UI immediately
- External channel delivery (Discord, Slack, etc.) is **not** enabled in v1 — all output stays within Mission Control

If the comment POST fails after a successful dispatch, the failure is logged but the dispatch is still recorded as succeeded. The response text is preserved in the `openclaw_dispatch_attempts.response_excerpt` column for debugging.

### Per-Agent Configuration

Agents are linked to OpenClaw by setting `capabilities.openclaw` during registration:

```json
{
  "name": "code-reviewer",
  "session_key": "code-reviewer-01",
  "capabilities": {
    "openclaw": {
      "enabled": true,
      "agentName": "code-reviewer",
      "agentId": "oc-agent-uuid"
    }
  }
}
```

## Middleware

### Correlation ID

Every request gets an `x-correlation-id` header — propagated from the incoming request or auto-generated as a UUID.

### Idempotency

Write requests (`POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) with an `Idempotency-Key` header get response caching in Redis (24h TTL). Repeated requests with the same key return the cached response. Non-2xx responses are not cached, allowing retries.

## Database

9 tables, 18 indexes, enforced by CHECK constraints and foreign keys (all `ON DELETE CASCADE`):

| Table           | Purpose                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agents`        | Agent registry with status, capabilities, heartbeat config     |
| `tasks`         | Task queue with state machine, priority, required capabilities |
| `assignments`   | Lease-based task-to-agent assignments                          |
| `notifications` | Notification queue with retry tracking                         |
| `activities`    | Append-only activity log (event sourcing)                      |
| `comments`      | Task comments with @-mention support                           |
| `subscriptions`               | Agent-to-task subscription mapping                                                        |
| `openclaw_dispatch_attempts`  | Per-attempt record of OpenClaw dispatches — status, error, response excerpt, retry count  |
| `_migrations`                 | Migration tracking                                                                        |

Run migrations with:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate    # Applies pending SQL migrations from db/migrations/
pnpm db:seed       # Seeds demo data (3 agents, 10 tasks, comments, notifications)
```

## Dashboard

The Mission UI at `http://localhost:5173` provides:

- **Dashboard** (`/`) — Fleet status grid with online/offline indicators, task state counters, real-time activity feed via SSE
- **Task Board** (`/tasks`) — Kanban board with drag-and-drop state transitions and inline task creation
- **Task Detail** (`/tasks/:id`) — Assignment history, comments with @-mention autocomplete
- **Agent Detail** (`/agents/:id`) — Agent info, active assignments, notification inbox with acknowledge

Data is fetched via polling (5s interval) and SSE streaming. No external state library — all state is component-local via React hooks.

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (control-api + mission-ui)
pnpm test

# Integration tests (requires running API + Postgres + Redis)
pnpm test:integration
```

### Unit Tests

- **Control API** — 9 test files covering: health endpoint, agent status transitions, heartbeat service with Redis dedup, task state machine (all valid/invalid transitions), correlation ID middleware, idempotency middleware, subscription logic, notification lifecycle with retries, @-mention parsing
- **Mission UI** — 5 test files covering: ActivityFeed rendering, StatusBadge styling, TimeAgo formatting, Dashboard with mocked API, TaskBoard with mocked API

### Integration Tests

31 tests across 7 files against a live API + database, run sequentially (`fileParallelism: false`):

- **Heartbeat lifecycle** — registration, offline→online transition, sequence dedup, offline detection, recovery
- **Assignment lifecycle** — task creation, state transitions, full offer→accept→complete flow, lease expiry and requeue
- **Chaos scenarios** — rapid agent churn (50 concurrent heartbeats), concurrent assignment races (5 agents, 1 task), worker restart simulation
- **Load testing** — 200 tasks with zero double-active assignment verification
- **Notification flow** — comment→subscribe→notify pipeline, @-mention resolution, dedup, acknowledgement
- **Reliability** — 3 agents + 20 tasks with crash recovery and reassignment, idempotency key replay, correlation ID propagation
